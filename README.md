## Usage Examples

This section provides examples of how to use the TF GitHub Action in various scenarios, from simple validation to multi-environment deployments with approval gates.

### Basic Usage

#### Validate Only
Perfect for pull requests to ensure OpenTofu configuration is valid without making any changes.

```yaml
name: Validate Only

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate Configuration
        uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
        with:
          workdir: ./infra
          steps: validate
```

#### Plan Only
Generate and review execution plans without applying changes. Useful for code review and change approval processes.

```yaml
name: Plan Only

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Plan Changes
        uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
        with:
          workdir: ./infra
          steps: plan
```

#### Plan and Apply
Complete workflow that validates, plans, and applies changes. Best for automated deployments to development environments.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Development

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Deploy to Development Environment
        uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
        with:
          workdir: ./infra
          env: dev
          steps: all  # Runs validate, plan, and apply
```

### Variable Configuration Examples

#### Using tfvar Files (Comma-separated)
Load multiple variable files to configure your infrastructure with shared and environment-specific settings.

```yaml
- name: Deploy with Multiple Variable Files
  uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
  with:
    workdir: ./infra
    env: dev
    tfvar-files: common.tfvars, prod.tfvars
    steps: all
```
> `tfvar-files` can be comma, space or newline separated.

#### Inline Variables (Newline-separated)
Pass variables directly in the workflow for simple configurations or dynamic values.

```yaml
- name: Deploy with Inline Variables
  uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
  with:
    workdir: ./infra
    env: dev
    tfvars: |
      environment=development
      region=us-west-2
      instance_count=2
    steps: all
```

#### Mixed Variable Sources
Combine variable files and inline variables for maximum flexibility.

```yaml
- name: Deploy with Mixed Variable Sources
  uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
  with:
    workdir: ./infra
    env: dev
    tfvar-files: base.tfvars, dev.tfvars
    tfvars: |
      build_number=${{ github.run_number }}
      commit_sha=${{ github.sha }}
      deployed_by=${{ github.actor }}
      deployment_time=${{ github.event.head_commit.timestamp }}
    steps: all
```

### Backend Configuration Examples

#### Backend Configuration Files
Use configuration files to manage remote state across different environments.

```yaml
- name: Initialize with Backend Configuration Files
  uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
  with:
    workdir: ./infra
    env: staging
    backend-config-var-files: backend-base.conf, backend-staging.conf
    steps: plan
```

#### Inline Backend Configuration
Configure remote state directly in the workflow for dynamic setups.

```yaml
- name: Configure Remote State Inline
  uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
  with:
    workdir: ./infra
    backend-config-vars: |
      bucket=my-terraform-state-${{ github.repository_owner }}
      key=${{ github.repository }}/terraform.tfstate
      region=us-west-2
      encrypt=true
    steps: all
```

### Approval Gates

Public and Enterprise private GitHub repositories can apply deployment protection rules. These can require people or teams to approve a workflow before using a specific environment. Deployment protection rules are an excellent way to require approval before applying changes - we simply separate our plan and apply steps, with the apply step running in a protected environment.

#### Separate Plan and Apply Jobs
This pattern separates planning from applying, allowing for review and approval between steps.

```yaml
name: Infrastructure Deployment with Approval

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  plan:
    name: Plan Infrastructure Changes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Plan Production Changes
        uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
        with:
          workdir: ./infra
          env: prod
          tfvar-files: base.tfvars, prod.tfvars
          tfvars: build_number=${{ github.run_number }}
          steps: validate plan

  apply:
    name: Apply Infrastructure Changes
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: plan
    environment: prod  # This environment can have protection rules
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Apply Production Changes
        uses: coresolutionsltd/tf-github-action@main
        with:
          workdir: ./infra
          env: prod  # env must match what is planned
          steps: apply  # Only apply, plan artifact is downloaded automatically
```

These examples are meant to give you the building blocks for putting together a complete infrastructure deployment workflow. You can mix and match them to create pipelines that validate, plan, and apply your configuration, while also adding steps for review and approval where it makes sense.

Use these patterns as starting points and adapt them to fit the way your team works.

If something doesnâ€™t quite work for you, or thereâ€™s a use case we havenâ€™t covered yet, please open an [issue](../../issues) and weâ€™ll look into adding it.

- **Pre-commit Hooks**
  - Install and enable [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) before committing.
